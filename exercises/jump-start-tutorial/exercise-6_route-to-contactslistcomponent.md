# Exercise: Route to your first component

The time has come! Let's implement some routing features. In this exercise we're going to route to components.

## Scenario

In order to route from our contacts list to a contact detail page, the first thing we need to do is to extract the current contacts list implementation into its own component, so that `ContactsApp` is just a "frame" that holds our app, consisting of multiple components, together.

We can create a new component `ContactsListComponent` using angular-cli by running:

```
$ ng generate component contacts-list-component
```

## Tasks

1. Create a component `ContactsListComponent` with angular-cli and move the current contact list logic and template there from `ContactsApp`
2. Import the new `ContactsListComponent` in the main `ContactsApp` component
3. Import `ROUTER_PROVIDERS`, `ROUTER_DIRECTIVES` and `RouteConfig` from `angular2/router`
4. Add `ROUTER_PROVDERS` to `ContactsApp`'s providers
5. Add `@RouteConfig()` decorator to `ContactsApp` with a configuration where `/` points to `ContactsListComponent`
6. Add `ROUTER_DIRECTIVES` to `ContactsApp`'s directive dependencies
7. Add `<router-outlet>` in `ContactsApp`'s view to load and render components
